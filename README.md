# Java-ShipClassificationSystem

Welcome to Java-ShipClassificationSystem, a Java-based project that models different types of ships (Cruise, Cargo, and Tanker) 
using object-oriented programming principles. This repository provides a comprehensive illustration of inheritance, polymorphism, 
and interfaces through a well-structured class hierarchy and implementation of the Comparable interface for sorting ships based on 
specific attributes.

Key Features:

Ship Class Hierarchy: Features a base Ship class and extended classes CruiseShip, CargoShip, and TankerShip, each with unique properties and behaviors.

Implementation of Comparable Interface: Each ship type implements the Comparable interface, allowing for sorting based on different criteria like 
passenger capacity, cargo capacity, and liquid type.

Polymorphic Design: Demonstrates polymorphism and method overriding, particularly in the toString methods of each class, providing specific string
representations based on the ship type.

Interactive Main Class: The Main class creates instances of each ship type, demonstrating their characteristics and sorting capabilities in a real-world context.

Educational and Practical: Ideal for students and Java practitioners interested in understanding how object-oriented design principles can be applied to model complex systems.

Opportunity for Expansion: Contributors are encouraged to add new ship types, enhance existing functionalities, or provide additional sorting criteria.
